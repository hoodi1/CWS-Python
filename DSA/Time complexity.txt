Time complexity 

Add : do this, then when you are all done, do that
	e.g. - for i in range(0,n):	-> O(n)
	       	  print(i)
	       for j in range(0,n):  	-> O(m)
		  print(j)	 
		TC -> O(n+m)

Multiply : do this for each time you do that
	e.g. - for i in range(0,n):		-> O(n)
	           for j in range(0,n):  	-> O(m)
		  	print(i,j)
		TC -> O(n*m)
